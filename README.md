# DMX Seven Segment
An implementation of a DMX controller using a seven segment display
on an ATmega32A.

This utilises a small board with three buttons for up/down/channel
and a seven segment display to show the value.  A WS2812 shows the
RGB value.

All of the code is written to be run directly on the ATmega32A
without any external libraries other than AVR-Libc.
